<h1 style='font-size: 40pt;'> The Assignment </h1> <br> <br> <br>
<p> In this assignment, you will be implementing the code described in
Chapter 4 of Ben Fry's book:
<a class="nav" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596514557?ie=UTF8&tag=processing09-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596514557"> <i> Visualizing Data</i></a>;
we have provided you with a
<a class="nav" href="http://sci.utah.edu/~miriah/cs6630/protected/VisualizingData-4.pdf"> copy of the chapter</a>.
Please note that some of the scanned figures are distorted; thus, your
visualization may look slightly different than what you see, which is
okay! For each of the steps below, include a screenshot of your
visualization and answer the questions in a digital notebook (similar to
the DATA EXPLORATION assignment). You will be submitting this digital notebook and
the final version of your code for the assignment. </p>

<p> Before reading the chapter, download and install
<a class="nav" href="https://processing.org/download/?processing">Processing</a>,
and explore the
<a class="nav" href="http://processing.org/learning/topics/">examples online</a>.
We highly recommend you go through some of the
<a class="nav" href="http://processing.org/learning/">tutorials</a>,
in particular the first four at the <i>Beginner</i> level. </p>

<p> Complete the following steps. Feel free to make changes to the
design of the visualization as you see fit, and, if you do, be sure to justify
those changes in your notebook. <ol>
      <li> Download
        <a href="protected/timeSeries.zip" class="nav">timeSeries.zip</a>
          and extract it. This will be your project directory; to add code, simply open
            <tt> timeSeries.pde </tt> in Processing. No need to
              download additional files, just start programming! </li>

                <li> Read pages 54-72, and implement the code described in the
                  book. <b>Change</b> the numerical labels on the x- and y-axes to use the
                    Georgia font, and all of the text titles to use the Verdana font.
                      <b>Choose</b> a font size that seems most appropriate to you.
                        <b>Change</b> the y-axis title to run along the axis, i.e. rotate
                          it by 90-degrees (hint: look under the Transform section of the
                            <a class="nav" href="http://processing.org/reference/">reference page</a>).
                              <b>Make</b> any other changes you feel are appropriate. What did
                                you change and why? </li>

                                  <li>Read pages 73-82, and implement the code described in the book.
                                    <b>Allow</b> the user to select which representation to render the data
                                      using the keyboard. Specifically, let <tt>1</tt> select dots; <tt>2</tt>
                                        select connected dots; <tt>3</tt> select line chart; <tt>4</tt> select
                                          filled chart. (hint: look under the Input section of the
                                            <a class="nav" href="http://processing.org/reference/">reference page</a>).
                                              <b>Use</b> the Georgia font for the highlight tags on mouse rollover.
                                                What representation do you think is the most appropriate, and why? </li>

                                                  <li> Read pages 83-93, and implement the code described in the book.
                                                    You may <b>skip</b> the <i>Better Tab Images</i> section if you want.
                                                      For the interpolation, a new <tt>Integrator</tt> class has been provided for
                                                        you. Is this tool an effective way to look at time series data?
                                                          Why or why not? What is missing? How would you change the tool to support
                                                            looking at time series with many time points (like > 1000)? </li>
