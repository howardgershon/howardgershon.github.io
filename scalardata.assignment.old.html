    <p> <b> Data Reader </b> <br />
This time around, you will be writing your own data reader in Processing
to generate an image. To start off, you will be using this data set:
<a href="http://sci.utah.edu/~miriah/cs6630/protected/scalar-data/brain.nrrd" class="nav">brain.nrrd</a>.
Note that this data uses the NRRD file format. You can find the
<a href="http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html" class="nav">
definition of the NRRD file format</a> as well as several different
<a href="http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/files/index.html" class="nav">
example NRRD files</a> online. </p>

<p> It is important to understand what is represented in the header and how
this connects to the format of the data below the header. In
particular, the <i> dimension </i> component describes that we have a
regular 2-D grid. Also, the <i> sizes </i> component gives us the width
and height of this grid, respectively. Lastly, the <i> encoding </i>
component tells us that we have data written as text (human-readable). </p>

<p> After the header, each row of our data represents a single point in the
grid. For this assignment, each row contains one scalar value. The grid
iterates through the x-axis first, then the y-axis. </p>

<div id="random_imgs">
  <img src="http://sci.utah.edu/~miriah/cs6630/images/scalar-data-brain.png" width="125" height="175" />
</div>

<p> With the NRRD format in mind, write your data reader in Processing that
will store the data in your sketch. Storing the data in a 2-D
array is recommended. For more on 2-D arrays, see the corresponding
<a href="http://processing.org/tutorials/2darray/" class="nav">
Processing tutorial</a>. Be sure that you also read in the important values
from the header, particularly the <i> sizes </i> components, to set the
two dimensions of your data array. You should only be reading in data
during the setup() loop. Some functions to consider:
loadStrings(), for(), split(), & float(). </p>

<p> Once you have imported the data into your sketch, create a grayscale image
using the same dimensions as the data grid, see the example to the right.
For drawing each data point, we
recommend using either point(), rect(), or PImage(). Be mindful of your fill() and stroke()
values in your draw loop. You may wish to add a mouse or key command to save your
sketch as an image: save(). </p>

<!-- <p> In your digital notebook, add in your grayscale image, and be sure to answer the following: </p> -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li> was this easy to import the data? </li> -->
<!--   <li> what problems did you have? </li> -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<p> <b> Applying a Color Map </b> <br />
<div id="random_imgs">
  <img src="http://sci.utah.edu/~miriah/cs6630/images/scalar-data-brain-color.png" width="125" height="175" />
</div>
Time to apply some color! First, choose an appropriate color map from ColorBrewer
or another source. Interpret this color map into a continuous space; do not use
a binned color map. One way to do this is to use two or three colors that are
starting, middle, and ending values for your color map. You will need
a function that will take a scalar value and then map it to a
color along your new continuous colormap.</p>

<p> Now, for each scalar value, map or convert these data values into colors using
your color map. This assigns a color to each pixel of your image. This should
produce a continuous color image for your data. Some functions to consider:
map(), lerpColor(). </p>

<p> In your digital notebook, add your color mapped image, and be sure to answer: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Where did you get your color map? </li>
  <li> What makes it an appropriate color map for this data? </li>
</ul>

<p> You may want to experiment with several colormaps. If you do, make
sure to include screenshots of your work!</p>

<p> <b> Interpolating the Grid </b> <br />
<div id="random_imgs">
  <img src="http://sci.utah.edu/~miriah/cs6630/images/scalar-data-brain-color-no-interp.png" width="100" height="140" />
</div>
Next, we will make our image larger by changing the size of our Processing sketch.
Instead of using the sizes of our grid, we will fix the <b>height</b> of our sketch to 800 pixels.
Keep the same aspect ratio for the grid (preserve the ratio of width to height).
After creating a larger sketch, map your original data grid values into the appropriate
pixel values to fill the screen. This will result in an image that looks pixelated (see right, top). </p>

<p> Keep in mind that Processing expects integers in its size() function, but division
with integers can result in rounding issues in programming languages. You can always
convert or cast your data from floating point numbers into integers for this function. </p>

<div id="random_imgs">
  <img src="http://sci.utah.edu/~miriah/cs6630/images/scalar-data-brain-color-interp.png" width="100" height="140" />
</div>

<p> To smooth out our image, we will perform bilinear interpolation of the data.
This process effectively maps every pixel on our screen into the data grid,
in-between four values of that grid. Then, we find an interpolated value between
these four grid points. Now, this pixel uses this interpolation to get a color from
our color map (see right, bottom). To properly see the difference between the two examples,
open them in a new tab or download to compare. Also, be mindful of pixels on the edges
of the image. </p>

<p> In your digital notebook, add your interpolated image, and be sure to answer: </p>
<ul>
  <li> What, if anything, makes interpolation of your data tricky? </li>
  <li> Do you notice anything odd about the data? Do any values stick out? </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in the next part of the assignment you will be using a
different technique to visualize this data (isocontours). You will
need to switch between these two modes use keystrokes. This is an FYI
for planning how you structure this part of the assignment!</p>



<p> <b> Isocontours using Marching Squares </b> <br />
tbd </p>

<!-- we can ask students to evaluate their marching squares algorithm -->
<!-- - does it fail anywhere or does it work flawlessly? they can -->
<!-- include images of the test dataset & the brain dataset -->


<p> <b> Extra Credit </b><br/>
Instead of using bilinear interpolation in both your colormapping and
isocontouring techniques, implement bicubic interpolation. This
is a different interpolation function for reconstructing data values
between grid vertices. Obtain
images using both techniques and compare them. Feel free to try out different
sizes of images to compare the two interpolation methods. Include
sample images of both bilinear and bicubic
in your digital notebook, and answer the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li> What does bicubic interpolation change in the output image? </li>
  <li> Does bicubic interpolation make a difference when we have a larger image? </li>
  <li> Are there any features that bicubic interpolation is better for? </li>
</ul>

<p>Allow the user to switch between bilinear and bicubic interpolation
methods using the 'i' key.</p>

<p> <b> Data Exploration </b> <br />
tbd </p>

<!-- we can have students explore the mtHood dataset, see how it affects their color map & how isocontours look -->

<p> <b> Data Sets </b> <br/>
We have provided the following three data sets for this assignment.
They all use the
<a href="http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html" class="nav">
    NRRD file format</a>. </p>

<p> <a href="http://sci.utah.edu/~miriah/cs6630/protected/scalar-data/brain.nrrd" class="nav">brain.nrrd</a>:
This data set contains scalar values measured from a 2D slice of a brain. </p>

we will add these data sets with the next part of the assignment:

<p> <a href="http://sci.utah.edu/~miriah/cs6630/protected/scalar-data/test.nrrd" class="nav">test.nrrd</a>:
This data set is a randomly-generated 2D grid</a> which tests all
possible cases of the marching squares algorithm. Test your
isocontours against this test case first. <br />
<i> source: </i>
<a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/" class="nav">Gordon Kindlmann</a> </p>

<p> <a href="http://sci.utah.edu/~miriah/cs6630/protected/scalar-data/mtHood.nrrd" class="nav">mtHood.nrrd</a>:
This data set contains scalar values measured from a 2D spatial grid
which represents a height field around Mount Hood in Oregon.
Please note that this data is diverging, and that the positive vs.
negative values have inverted ranges from each other. As such,
when appropriately mapped, you should see a clean gradient between
all values and colors. </p>
