      <h2> JavaScript </h2> <br>
      <p>
        JavaScript has been a little obsession of mine for a few years. I have created a few web pages that showcase a few JavaScript libraries. In this <a href='./meetup.html'>example</a> I use JavaScript to read a websocket stream from the Meetup site to map out RSVP's to local Meetups. In this <a href='./pindrop.html'>example</a>, I use javascript to drop pins on a map. I have a few other examples <a href='./cs6630/'>here</a>.

      <h2> JQuery </h2> <br>
      <p>
        Coding JavaScript in such a way that elements are as dynamic as I want them to be can be a difficult task. JQuery helps with this. JQuery is a library that makes manipulation of the DOM much easier by providing the developer with many functions already written. Below is little example made with JQuery.<br>
        <nav style="text-align:center;"><div class='jq'>1</div>
        <div class='jq'>2</div>
        <div class='jq'>3</div>
        <div class='jq'>4</div>
        <span id='close'> x </span></nav>
