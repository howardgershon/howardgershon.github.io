        <span style='font-size: 40pt;'> The Assignment </span> <br> <br> <br>
   <p> First, you will want to understand what parallel coordinates are.
Please read the following short discussions: <ul>
  <li> <a class="nav" href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/private/book/book.120803.pdf">Section
  8.1.6.2 <i>Parallel Layouts</i></a> in Information Visualization by Tamara Munzner </li>
  <li><a class="nav" href="http://sci.utah.edu/~miriah/cs6630/protected/DataVisualization-11.6.pdf">Section 11.6
  <i>Multivariate Data Visualization</i></a> in Data Visualization by Alexandru Telea </li>
</ul> </p>

<p> Next, play around with this
<a href="http://bl.ocks.org/jasondavies/raw/1341281/" class="nav">nice example</a>
written by Jason Davies in the
<a href="http://d3js.org/" class="nav">D3.js language</a>.
Different data can be seen in the
<a href="http://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/examples/veterans.html" class="nav"><i>veterans</i></a>
and <a href="http://exposedata.com/parallel/" class="nav"><i>nutrient contents</i></a>
examples by Kai Chang. In these examples, note that you can
filter along an axis and rearrange axes. Think about what you like
in the designs and what you would want to do differently. There are
many different ways to encode, layout, and interact with data in a
parallel coordinates plot -- these examples are just one way to do
this. There is no "right" answer! </p>

<p> <b> Data Wrangling </b> <br/>
To start, download the <i> cars </i> data set, provided below. Inspect
the data -- it does not come in the <i>.csv</i> file format that
you worked with in the TIME SERIES assignment. The data needs to be
cleaned and processed to get it into Processing. You are welcome to
re-use the <tt> FloatTable.pde </tt> file reader from the previous
assignment to import the data. </p>

<p> <b> Basic Visualization </b> <br/>
Before writing code, pull out a piece of paper. Create a paper
prototype of what you envision the visualization will look like.
Consider the basic items that you will render: like axes, data,
title, labels, tick marks, etc. Think about how you plan to handle
overlapping lines (e.g. use transparency). Keep this paper prototype;
use it to motivate your Processing sketch. </p>

<p> Next, create a Processing sketch for the assignment. Get the
<i> cars </i> data set imported (feel free to use <tt> FloatTable.pde</tt>),
and write a basic renderer to create a static parallel coordinates plot.
In your sketch, be sure to label everything you can: titles, tick marks,
ranges, etc. In your digital notebook, include a screenshot of this static
version of your visualization. Were you able to include everything that
you had thought of in your paper prototype? Please record some of your
thoughts on this sketching and coding process in your notebook. </p>

<p> <b> Interactivity </b> <br/>
Now, for the fun part! Parallel coordinates are hardly useful without
interactivity. Instead of worrying about how to code interaction, first
set the computer aside and pull out another piece of paper. Think about
how you want to interact with the axes and the data. How would you design
these interactions to make them effective? At minimum, you must support
the following basic interactions: <ul>
  <li> filter the data across multiple attributes </li>
  <li> reorder / rearrange the axes </li>
  <li> invert the axes </li> </ul> </p>

<p> For each of these interactions (and any more you want),
draw a series of story boards, i.e. a sequence of sketches that
illustrate the steps behind an interaction in the visualization.
Be sure to show any interface elements that the user will interact with.
This just needs to be enough to give you an idea of what you want to
write in the code. Then, create a digital copy of your story boards,
and add each of the story boards to your digital notebook, with a
brief description of what is occurring in each story board. </p>

<p> Next, implement your ideas! </p>

<p> In your notebook, include a screenshot of your interactive
visualization, describe how your interactivity works, and justify
your design decisions using concepts we have covered in the class.
Does your design work? What could be improved, given more time, and how?
Did you come up with any interactivity mechanisms to support tasks other
than those described above? </p>

<p> <b> Clustering </b> (<i>for 6630 students only | extra credit for
  5630 students</i>) <br/>
It is often useful to aggregate multidimensional data into clusters
of similar data points. A very simple method for aggregation is
<a class="nav" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">
k-means clustering</a>. For this portion of the assignment, you must
use k-means clustering to aggregate data, and develop a way to show
the clusters in your visualization. </p>

<p> You may use existing k-mean clustering algorithms to create your
clusters, or be adventurous and implement it yourself (it is
straight-forward to do). Experiment with number of clusters you
create and find a number that does a good job in creating meaningful
clusters. We would recommend doing this experimentation in your
visualization, once you implement a visual representation for the clusters. </p>

<div id="random_imgs">
  <img src="http://sci.utah.edu/~miriah/cs6630/images/interactive-color-legend.png" width="76" height="200" />
</div>

<p> The most obvious way to show clusters is to assign each cluster
a color (hue) and render the data (lines) in the appropriate color,
according to their cluster membership. When encoding categorical data
with color, however, remember that we can only distinguish a limited
number of colors -- how many can we actually distinguish? Design your
visual encoding accordingly. You are free to develop a different way
to encode the clusters if you would like. However you encode the
clusters, allow the user to choose to show the clusters, or not.
Include a screenshot of your visualization with the cluster encoding
in your notebook along with a description of your encoding method. </p>

<p> <b> extra credit: </b>
A way to accommodate a limited color palette is by creating an
interactive color legend. An example is shown in the image on the right.
This legend allows the user to apply a color to a specific group, or
have a default color of gray. This visualization widget thus serves
dual purpose: it works as a legend to inform the user about the encoding,
and it also lets the user dynamically set the color of each group.
Implement your own interactive color legend. </p>

<p> <b> Data Exploration </b> <br/>
Explore at least two data sets (one of which should be the <i>cars</i>
data set) in your parallel coordinates tool. What interesting
features can you find? For each data set, document several features
that you find, and include both a description and a screenshot of
each in your notebook. </p>

<p> Lastly, critique your parallel coordinate visualization in your
notebook. What do you think of parallel coordinates as a visualization
representation? Do you find it easy or hard to use? Could you have
found those same features without interactivity? What are the limits
of parallel coordinates for data other than quantitative data, and
how might you visualize that? </p>

<p> <b> Data Sets </b> <br/>
We have provided the following two data sets and encourage you to use
both of them in order to get started quickly and therefore have more
time to explore the data and develop your visualization tool -- we
recommend you develop your visualization using the <i> cars </i> data
set. You are welcome to use a different second data set, if you prefer. </p>

<p> <i> cars: </i>
This data set contains information on 406 different cars from the

different attributes.</p>
